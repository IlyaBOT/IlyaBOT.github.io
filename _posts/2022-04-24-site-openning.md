# Hello, Bronies!

**Today**, we have opened our website, where we will publish news about the project, and there are also useful links and articles here. If you are here for the first time, then be sure to visit the "About us" page. If you are interested in our project, then read the "[Rules](/rules/)" and click the "[PLAY](steam://connect/95.84.136.207:27015)" button at the top of the page, **`Steam`** will automatically start (If it was not launched), **`Garry's Mod`** (If it was not launched) and the connection to our server will begin.

### We wish you a nice game, _@Las Pegasus Team_.
